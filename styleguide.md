# A century of gathering clouds.

Ghost ships arriving and leaving.

## The sea deeper, vaster.

The parrot in the bamboo cage spoke several languages.

### The captain

The captain in the [daguerreotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype)
had his cheeks painted red. He brought a half-naked girl from the tropics whom
they kept chained in the attic even after his death. At night she made sounds
that could have been singing.

> The captain told of a race of [men without mouths](#0) who subsisted only on scents
> of flowers.

This made his wife and mother say a prayer for the salvation of all the
unbaptized souls. Once, however, we caught the captain taking off his beard. It
was false! Under it he had another beard equally absurd looking.

```
It was the age of busy widows' walks.
```

The dead languages of love were still in use, but also much silence, much
soundless screaming at the top of the lungs.
