# Welcome to grdn

The plants welcome you. Stay a while, plant your own.

Anything you publish to your `:username/grdn` repo will appear on this site. Your `README.md` will serve as your homepage. Any other files will appear as pages.

Files are hashed and the hashes appended to your URL. Try to link to hashed URLs when you can. They load faster, and it helps us avoid ~link~ root rot.

Happy gardening ðŸª´
