# An excerpt from _The Aran Islands_ by J. M. Synge

[T]he boys' school, where I sometimes look in... is a comfort-less building in a
terribly bleak position. In cold weather the children arrive in the morning with
a sod of turf tied up with their books, a simple toll which keeps the fire well
supplied, yet, I believe, a more modern method is soon to be introduced.

...It is hard to believe that those hovels I can just see in the south are
filled with people whose lives have the strange quality that is found in the
oldest poetry and legend. Compared with them the falling off that has come with
the increased prosperity of this island is full of discouragement. The charm
which the people over there share with the birds and flowers has been replaced
here by the anxiety of men who are eager for gain.
